FLEX PART:
"main.c" includes function that takes values of Token's and prints their name.
"scanner.h" includes TOKEN's values.
You need to use "cc gpp_lexer.c main.c -o test" to test my homework.(it doesn't have to be "test". It can be anything)
when i compile "gpp_lexer.l" it produces "lex.yy.c". So, i renamed that file to "gpp_lexer.c".

LISP:

You need to use "clisp gpp_lexer.lisp" to test my homework.
First part tests with 0 inputs which takes inputs from user via command line.
Second part takes an input which is a file name.
There is an example test file named "test.txt" in the zip file.

I uploded my hw then, removed it and made some changes. When i upload again it puts a number end of the file name.
It's a feature of the Microsoft Teams.It seems,i can't do anything about it.
